        <p> Is <strong> AI </strong> good or bad ?! 
           

            <p>There are plenty of very useful applications of AI. Some are groundbreaking and change the world, some we use every single day. Here are some examples of some everyday uses of A.I  :</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Email spam filters </li>
                <li> Netflix reccomendations </li>
                <li> Fraud detection</li>
                <li> Social media feeds</li>
                <li> and much much more....</li>
            </ul>

            <p>But with the great opportunities this technology has, it also brings risks. Artificial Intelligence is very determined in reaching its goal. Whether its finding you a new show to watch or driving a car, it will do everything it can to reach that goal. Things can go wrong if either an AI is given a bad goal , for example spreading hate propoganda on facebook, or if AI finds a destructive path to reach its goal. For example, even for a beneficial goal like lowering fossil fuels used,an AAI with no restrictions might decide the best way to decrease our global footprint is to lower the population, which obviously isn't good for us!</p>
